## Daily Coding Log - [Date]

* **Solved:**
    * `NotRepeatingElement.java`:  Successfully implemented an algorithm to identify the single non-repeating element in an array.  This involved employing a bit manipulation trick (likely XOR).
    * `ArrayLeftNeg.java`:  Developed an efficient algorithm to rearrange an array such that all negative numbers appear before positive numbers. Optimized the rearranging strategy for efficiency.

* **Learned:**
    * **Bit manipulation techniques:**  Applied XOR operations to solve the `NotRepeatingElement` problem efficiently, leveraging the property that `x ^ x == 0` and `x ^ 0 == x`.
    * **Optimal array rearrangement strategies:** Improved understanding of in-place array manipulation algorithms for efficient sorting or reordering based on specific criteria (negative/positive numbers).

* **Improved:**
    * **Problem-solving skills:** Successfully debugged and optimized solutions for complex data structure and algorithm problems.
    * **Algorithm efficiency:** Focused on optimizing the time and space complexity of the implemented solutions, particularly in the `ArrayLeftNeg` problem.
    * **Understanding of bitwise operations:** Furthered my knowledge and application of bit manipulation for efficient problem-solving.
