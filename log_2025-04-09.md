## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the new sorting algorithm for the user data, resulting in a 30% performance improvement.  Resolved the edge case where duplicate entries were causing incorrect ordering.
    * Fixed the bug in the API call that was causing intermittent 500 errors. The issue stemmed from incorrect handling of null values in the request payload.
    * Completed the unit tests for the newly added feature (user profile customization).  Achieved 100% code coverage.

* **Learned:**
    * Gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the `merge sort` algorithm and its optimal application in various scenarios.
    * Explored best practices for handling API error responses and implemented robust error handling mechanisms.
    * Refined my unit testing skills by focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions.  Learned how to utilize mocking more effectively.

* **Improved:**
    * Improved code readability and maintainability by refactoring the `userData` processing module.  Added clear comments and restructured the code for better logical flow.
    * Enhanced the API error handling by incorporating more informative error messages and logging.
    * Increased the overall test coverage of the application, improving confidence in the code's stability and functionality.
