## Daily Coding Log - [Date]

* **Solved:**
    * `NotRepeatingElement.java`: Implemented a solution to find the single non-repeating element in an array.  Addressed edge cases and optimized for efficiency.
    * `productDigits.java`: Created a function to calculate the product of all digits in a given integer.  Handled potential errors (e.g., negative input).
    * `ArrayOccurance.java`: Developed a method to count the occurrences of each element within an array.  Considered various approaches for optimal performance.

* **Learned:**
    * Reinforced my understanding of array manipulation techniques in Java.
    * Practiced efficient algorithm design and selection for different problem types.
    * Improved my ability to handle edge cases and potential errors in coding solutions.

* **Improved:**
    * Code readability and maintainability through better variable naming and commenting.
    * Problem-solving skills through systematic debugging and testing.
    * Confidence in tackling more complex Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.
