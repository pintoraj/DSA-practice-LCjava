## Daily Coding Log - [Date]

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the `calculate_average` function, handling edge cases like empty input lists and non-numeric values gracefully.  The function now returns a floating-point average, accurately reflecting the data.
    * Resolved the bug causing the `generate_report` function to incorrectly format dates. The issue stemmed from an incorrect date formatting string; this is now corrected.
    * Debugged a memory leak in the `process_large_file` function.  The leak was identified using a memory profiler and resolved by appropriately closing file handles.

* **Learned:**
    *  Improved understanding of Python's exception handling mechanisms, specifically the `try-except` block and different exception types.
    *  Learned how to effectively use a memory profiler to identify and resolve memory leaks in Python.
    *  Gained deeper insight into date and time formatting in Python, specifically using `strftime` and `strptime`.

* **Improved:**
    *  Refactored the `calculate_average` function for better readability and maintainability by extracting reusable subroutines.
    *  Added comprehensive unit tests for the `generate_report` function to prevent future regressions.
    *  Documented the `process_large_file` function with clear explanations of its purpose, parameters, and return values, using docstrings.
    *  Increased code coverage through additional unit tests, improving overall code quality.
