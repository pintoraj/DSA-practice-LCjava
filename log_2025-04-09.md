## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the new sorting algorithm for the user data, resulting in a 30% performance improvement.  Resolved the edge case where duplicate entries were not handled correctly.
    * Fixed the bug causing intermittent crashes in the network request handling module. The issue was traced to an improper thread synchronization.
    * Completed the unit tests for the newly added feature (user profile editing).  All tests passed.

* **Learned:**
    * Deeper understanding of thread synchronization mechanisms in Java, specifically the use of `ReentrantLock` and `Condition` objects.
    * Explored different sorting algorithms and their time complexities, choosing Merge Sort for optimal performance in this specific scenario.
    * Improved my understanding of REST API error handling and best practices for handling network request failures.

* **Improved:**
    * Refactored the code for user data processing to be more modular and maintainable.
    * Implemented better error logging throughout the application, providing more detailed information for debugging purposes.
    * Updated the project documentation to reflect the changes made today, including a more comprehensive explanation of the new sorting algorithm.
    * Increased unit test coverage for the application.
