## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the new pagination feature for the user profile page, resolving the performance issues with large datasets.  The solution involved switching from a naive approach to a server-side pagination implementation using offset and limit.
    * Debugged and fixed a critical bug in the authentication module that was causing intermittent login failures. The root cause was an improperly handled null value in the user database.
    * Completed the unit tests for the newly implemented file upload functionality, achieving 100% coverage.

* **Learned:**
    * Gained a deeper understanding of server-side pagination techniques and their performance implications.  Specifically, learned about the limitations of offset-based pagination and potential alternatives like cursor-based pagination.
    * Improved my debugging skills by effectively using logging and breakpoints to track down the intermittent authentication issue.
    * Expanded my knowledge of testing frameworks and best practices for writing comprehensive unit tests.

* **Improved:**
    * Refactored the code for the user profile page to improve readability and maintainability. This involved extracting reusable components and simplifying complex logic.
    * Increased the overall code coverage of the project's unit tests.  This will improve the stability and robustness of the application.
    * Optimized the database query for the user profile page, resulting in a significant performance boost. This involved adding appropriate indexes and refactoring the SQL query itself.
