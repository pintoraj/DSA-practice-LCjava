## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the `calculate_average` function, addressing the edge case of an empty input list.  Previously, this resulted in a `ZeroDivisionError`.
    * Debugged the intermittent error in the database connection.  The issue stemmed from an incorrect port number in the configuration file.
    * Completed the unit tests for the newly added `validate_input` function, achieving 100% test coverage.

* **Learned:**
    *  Improved understanding of exception handling in Python, specifically using `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle `ZeroDivisionError` and other potential runtime errors.
    * Gained familiarity with using environment variables for sensitive information like database connection details, enhancing security.
    * Explored the capabilities of the `pytest` framework for writing more robust and comprehensive unit tests.

* **Improved:**
    * Refactored the `process_data` function to improve readability and maintainability.  Split the function into smaller, more focused sub-functions.
    * Optimized the database query to significantly reduce query execution time by approximately 30%. Implemented an index on the relevant database column.
    * Updated documentation for the `calculate_average` and `validate_input` functions, making them clearer and easier to understand.

* **Challenges:**
    * Still need to investigate performance bottlenecks in the `generate_report` function.  Profiling tools will be used tomorrow.
    *  Further investigation is required on why the database connection is occasionally slow, despite optimization efforts.

* **Tomorrow's Plan:**
    * Profile the `generate_report` function to identify performance bottlenecks.
    * Investigate further the intermittent database connection slowdowns.
    * Begin work on the new feature: user authentication.
