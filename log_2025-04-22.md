## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the new sorting algorithm, resulting in a 30% performance improvement for large datasets.  (Specific algorithm name here, e.g.,  "Successfully implemented merge sort").
    * Resolved the intermittent null pointer exception in the `getUserData()` function by adding appropriate null checks.
    * Debugged and fixed the unexpected behavior in the UI when handling edge cases for user input.
* **Learned:**
    * Deeper understanding of the time complexity analysis of sorting algorithms.  (Specific details here, e.g., "Specifically learned the difference between O(n log n) and O(n^2) complexities and how this impacts performance").
    * Improved my debugging skills by effectively using the debugger and logging statements to identify and isolate the null pointer exception.
    * Explored different approaches to handling user input validation and error prevention in the UI.  (Specific techniques used, e.g., "Learned about using try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and regular expressions for input validation").
* **Improved:**
    * Refactored the `getUserData()` function to improve readability and maintainability.  (Specific changes made, e.g., "Extracted reusable components and added meaningful comments").
    * Updated documentation to reflect the changes made to the sorting algorithm and the `getUserData()` function.
    * Increased unit test coverage for the newly implemented features and bug fixes. (Specific details about unit testing, e.g., "Added five new unit tests for the merge sort function").
