## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the `calculate_average` function, addressing the edge case of empty input lists.  The function now accurately returns the average, handles zero division errors gracefully, and includes comprehensive unit tests.
    * Resolved the intermittent database connection issue by updating the connection string to reflect the correct port number. Database queries are now consistently successful.
    * Debugged the memory leak in the image processing module. The memory usage is now stable even after prolonged processing.

* **Learned:**
    * Explored the use of Python's `try-except` blocks for more robust error handling, specifically in the `calculate_average` function.
    * Gained a deeper understanding of SQL database connections and the importance of accurate connection parameters.
    * Improved my debugging skills by effectively using memory profiling tools to identify and eliminate the memory leak in the image processing module.

* **Improved:**
    * Refactored the `calculate_average` function for improved readability and maintainability.  Code comments were added for clarity.
    * Added comprehensive unit tests to the `calculate_average` function to ensure its continued accuracy and reliability.
    * Implemented a logging mechanism in the database connection module to track connection attempts and potential errors. This improves troubleshooting capabilities.
    * Optimized the image processing module's memory management, resulting in a significant reduction in memory footprint.
