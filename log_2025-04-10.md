## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the new data validation function, resolving the previous input errors.  This involved handling edge cases for null values and invalid data types.
    * Debugged and fixed a memory leak in the `process_large_file` function, significantly improving application performance.  The issue stemmed from improper resource management.
    * Resolved the UI rendering issue on smaller screens by adjusting the CSS responsiveness.
* **Learned:**
    * Gained a deeper understanding of memory management in C++ and the importance of using smart pointers.
    * Explored different techniques for validating user input and implemented robust error handling.
    * Learned how to efficiently debug memory leaks using Valgrind.  (or other debugging tool used)
    * Improved my understanding of CSS media queries and responsive design.
* **Improved:**
    * Application stability increased due to the fixed memory leak and improved input validation.
    * The application's UI is now more user-friendly on smaller screens.
    * Code readability was enhanced by refactoring the `process_large_file` function for better organization.
    * Added comprehensive unit tests for the new data validation function.

* **Challenges:**
    * Initially struggled to identify the root cause of the memory leak.  Further investigation is needed for a more thorough understanding of potential future issues.
    * The responsive CSS design required more iterations than initially anticipated.


* **Tomorrow's Plan:**
    * Implement integration tests for the `process_large_file` function.
    * Begin work on the new feature:  X (Specify new feature).
