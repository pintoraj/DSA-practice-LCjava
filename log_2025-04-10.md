## Daily Coding Log - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Solved:**
    * Successfully implemented the new user authentication system, resolving the previous vulnerability related to password storage.  This involved integrating bcrypt for password hashing.
    * Fixed the intermittent database connection error by adjusting the connection pooling settings in the configuration file.
    * Debugged and resolved a minor UI issue in the product listing page where images weren't displaying correctly on certain screen resolutions.

* **Learned:**
    * Gained a deeper understanding of bcrypt's role in enhancing application security and best practices for password handling.
    * Improved my understanding of database connection pooling and its impact on application performance.
    * Explored different responsive design techniques for image handling in web development to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

* **Improved:**
    * Increased application security by implementing bcrypt password hashing.
    * Enhanced application stability by optimizing database connection handling.
    * Improved user experience by fixing the image display issue on the product listing page, ensuring consistency across different devices.
    * Updated the project documentation to reflect the changes made.

* **Challenges:**
    * Debugging the database connection issue was initially time-consuming, requiring careful examination of logs and configuration settings.
    * Implementing responsive image handling needed careful consideration of different screen sizes and aspect ratios.


* **Tomorrow's Plan:**
    * Begin implementing unit tests for the new authentication system.
    * Investigate performance bottlenecks identified during today's debugging.
    * Continue work on the new reporting dashboard feature.
