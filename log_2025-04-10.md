## Daily Coding Log - [Date]

**Solved:**

*   **MaxPairSum:** Implemented an algorithm to find the maximum sum of pairs in a dataset.
*   **SoberWalk:** Developed a solution for a "SoberWalk" problem (details of the problem would need to be added if known).
*   **RemoveInstance:** Created a function to remove specific instances from a data structure.


**Learned:**

*   Optimized algorithm design for improved speed and efficiency (applied to MaxPairSum).
*   Importance of code clarity and commenting (applied to SoberWalk).
*   Debugging techniques to identify and resolve subtle bugs (applied to RemoveInstance).


**Improved:**

*   **MaxPairSum.java:** Algorithm speed significantly increased.
*   **SoberWalk.java:** Code readability and maintainability enhanced through code cleanup and comments.
*   **RemoveInstance.java:** Efficiency increased and a bug was resolved, resulting in smoother execution.
