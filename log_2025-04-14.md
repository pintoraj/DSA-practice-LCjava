Let's go with Option 3, as it reflects a common coding experience:

**Daily Coding Log - October 26, 2023**

* **Task:** Implemented `ToggleBits` function.
* **Type:** Fix (Initially a buggy implementation)
* **Description:**  The `ToggleBits` function proved more challenging than initially anticipated.  I encountered several unexpected edge cases related to handling negative numbers and bit boundaries.
* **Solution:** After a period of debugging (and a much-needed coffee break!), I identified and resolved the issues by carefully reviewing the bitwise operations and adding comprehensive error handling.  All tests now pass.
* **Learned:**  Debugging bit manipulation code requires meticulous attention to detail and a methodical approach. Taking regular breaks significantly improved my focus and problem-solving ability.
* **Improvements:** Enhanced understanding of bitwise operations, improved debugging skills, and reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
