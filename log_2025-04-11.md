## Daily Coding Log - [Date]

* **Solved:**
    * Implemented `ArrayLeftNeg` function: Successfully shifts all negative numbers in an array to the leftmost positions, maintaining relative order of both positive and negative numbers.
    * Implemented `ArrayRotate` function:  Successfully rotates an array's elements a specified number of positions, handling both positive and negative rotation values efficiently.

* **Learned:**
    * Refined my understanding of array manipulation techniques in [Programming Language Used, e.g., JavaScript, Python].
    * Practiced efficient in-place array modification algorithms to optimize performance.
    * Gained experience in handling edge cases and boundary conditions in array processing.

* **Improved:**
    * Improved coding style and readability for both `ArrayLeftNeg` and `ArrayRotate` functions.
    * Enhanced error handling to make the functions more robust.
    * Increased confidence in tackling complex array-based problems.
