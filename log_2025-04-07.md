## Daily Coding Log - [Date]

**Solved:**

* **MaxPairSum.java:**  Successfully implemented an algorithm to find the maximum sum of two numbers in an array.  Overcame initial difficulties in handling edge cases and optimizing for efficiency.
* **reverseDigits.java:** Created a function to reverse the digits of an integer.  Implemented an efficient and elegant solution.
* **priorElements.java:** Developed a function to efficiently retrieve prior elements in a data structure, preventing out-of-bounds exceptions.


**Learned:**

* Refined my approach to identifying and handling edge cases in array manipulation algorithms (MaxPairSum).
* Practiced efficient digit manipulation techniques for integer reversal (reverseDigits).
* Improved my understanding of handling index-related issues and boundary conditions when accessing elements in data structures (priorElements).


**Improved:**

* **Problem-solving skills:**  Successfully debugged and optimized solutions for three distinct algorithmic problems.
* **Algorithmic thinking:** Enhanced my ability to break down complex problems into manageable steps.
* **Code clarity and efficiency:**  Wrote more concise and efficient code for each solution.
